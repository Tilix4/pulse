Welcome to Pulse's documentation!
=================================

Pulse is a resource version control system. I think you already know what a version control system is (GIT, SVN, etc..)
but what the heck is a resource?

When one need to break apart a project in little pieces for team working, for versionning, it's a resource.
A resource can be a prop's modeling, a character's rigging, a shot's animation...

Pulse is written object oriented, and thus you will also meet other concepts than the resource. This is how
they articulate.
